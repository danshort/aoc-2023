Just working on solving [Advent of Code for 2023](https://adventofcode.com).

# Day 1
I solved Day 1 fairly quickly, but it took a lot of the Googling for me to refresh my memory on the `for` structures available in Node and JavaScript. It's quite literally been over two years since I committed a line of code at all, much less a production line of code. Was fun, but a bit frustrating to get this first solution going.
